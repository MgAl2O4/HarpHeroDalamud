# Harp Hero

Under construction. This will one day become a music performance assist plugin for Dalamud:
* show what and when to press
* do NOT play instead of player - there are already better tools for that

Currently it's in testable state, yay! 

To do:
* figure out what group play is about (is metronome sync enough?)
* visualize track transformation to show how badly it was mutilated
* high scores!
* localization

Done:
* importing tracks from midi file
* transforming midi tracks to fit game limitations (octave range, chords & overlapping notes, etc..)
* UI with track management, controls and configs
* training mode
* assistance modes: note, key bindings
* optional sync with game's metronome
