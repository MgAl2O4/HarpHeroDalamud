# Harp Hero

Under construction. This will one day become a music performance assist plugin for Dalamud:
* show what and when to press
* do NOT play instead of player - there are already better tools for that

Currently it's a working proof of concept with fair amount of hardcoded logic, nowhere near being ready for end users.  

To do:
* training mode
* figure out what group play is about (is metronome sync enough?)
* proper setup UI with all important params exposed (section, target bpm, etc)
* visualize track transformation to show how badly it was mutilated
* high scores!

Done:
* importing tracks from midi file
* transforming midi tracks to fit game limitations (octave range, chords & overlapping notes, etc..)
* basic UI for import, stat display & play controls
* note assistance mode
* keybind assistance mode
* optional sync with game's metronome
